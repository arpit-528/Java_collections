This repo is dedicated to the Java collections. Java Collections is a framework in Java that provides data structures and algorithms for manipulating and managing collections of data. It's a part of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) and provides a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.

Java Collections is a powerful tool for managing data in Java applications. By understanding its features, interfaces, and best practices, developers can write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.
